## Roadmap

1)Gathering the data

The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandhuh/data-science-jobs-in-india

2)Exploring/Cleaning data and feature engineering.

â€¢Python pandas and numpy were mainly used to explore the data with a little help of our friend Excel.
There were several same job roles written in different format.So by creating a function they were grouped into most relevant job roles.
â€¢Location column was also cleaned.
â€¢A separate column was generated for categorizing the type of job into remote or onsite
â€¢Many irrelevant values was also removed from Job experience column and min experience required column was fetched.
â€¢Working with skills column was tricky had to create a new dataframe using FreqDist.
â€¢The two dataframe were then saved into two separate xlsx files

3)Working with PowerBI

The two xlsx files were then loaded into PowerBI and various process were done to form a dashboard such as 
â€¢Data Modelling
â€¢Transform data
â€¢Add Column(to convert min. experience required into categories)
â€¢Dashboard Tiles
